** Concepts
- Decoupling of sender and receiver
- Receiver contains reference to next receiver
- Promotes loose coupling
- No Handler - OK
- Examples
	- java.util.logging.Logger
	- javax.servlet.Filter
	- Spring Security Filter Chain

** Pitfalls
- Handling/Handler guarantee
- Runtime configuration risk
- Chain lenght/performance issues
